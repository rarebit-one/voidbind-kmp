/// The SwiftUI app entry. Builds the ``AppModel`` once (which builds the
/// ``VoidbindEngine``, injecting the Swift Secure Enclave sealer into the KMP
/// library) and shows ``RootView`` — onboarding until this device is enrolled,
/// then the Home dashboard.
///
/// In DEBUG builds a `VOIDBIND_PREVIEW_SCREEN` environment variable renders a
/// single screen with sample data (see ``PreviewHarness``), so each screen can be
/// screenshotted headless in the Simulator without a device, camera, or network.
///
/// > Builds + runs in the iOS Simulator via the XcodeGen project (see
/// > iosApp/README.md). The biometric/Secure-Enclave paths still need a real
/// > device (docs/DEVICE-TESTING.md).
