 * This device's own membership over time (ADR-0005). An add lasts 90 days; a member
 * renews itself with a **self re-add** — an add of itself, signed by its own hardware
 * key, citing the replica's heads — while its current add is still valid. A lapsed
 * device's self re-add is `unauthorised` (voidbind-go vector
 * `self-renew-extends-membership`), so it can only be re-admitted by another member or
 * the recovery secret.
 *
 * Pure decisions over the replica; [DeviceVoidbindEngine] records and pushes the op.
