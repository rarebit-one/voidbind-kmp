/**
 * A login/pairing the app was WOKEN into from outside its own UI — by a push ping
 * ([Origin.PUSH]) or by another app's `voidbind:` deep link ([Origin.DEEP_LINK], the
 * same-device app-to-app handoff). The nav graph runs the identical approval flow a
 * scan does; the origin only decides what happens AFTER the human decides:
 *
 * - **PUSH** — stay in the authenticator (go Home), as before.
 * - **DEEP_LINK** — finish the activity so the calling app resumes (it is polling
 *   its broker for the outcome), and — only after a successful approval, and only if
 *   the RP supplied a well-formed private-scheme [callback] — launch that callback
 *   bare, so the RP can foreground itself. Nothing about the login (no id, no
 *   challenge, no signature) is ever appended to it.
 *
 * [seq] makes two identical wakes distinct so the second one re-fires the flow.
