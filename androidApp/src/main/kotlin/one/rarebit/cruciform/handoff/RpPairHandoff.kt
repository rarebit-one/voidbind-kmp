package one.rarebit.cruciform.handoff

/**
 * The **reverse** same-device handoff (ADR-0006, discovery per ADR-0009): this
 * authenticator holds a pairing invite it just minted (Settings → Devices → "Add a
 * device") and the NEW device is a relying-party app on the SAME phone — heyarr-mobile,
 * All Thing — which cannot scan our screen. ADR-0003 already lets an RP open us with a
 * `voidbind:` link; this is the mirror: we open the RP with its own **pair-callback**
 * URI carrying the invite.
 *
 *     heyarr-mobile://pair?invite=<percent-encoded voidbind:pair?… tuple>
 *     allthing://pair?invite=<…>
 *
 * The scheme is the RP's, never `voidbind:` — that one is ours, and firing it would
 * only loop back into this app. The invite tuple travels verbatim (byte-identical to
 * the QR), so the RP feeds it to the same `Invite.decode` a scan would; nothing here
 * is a new wire format.
 *
 * The list of targets is **discovered**, not hard-coded (#39 / ADR-0009): an RP
 * advertises itself with the shared [CATEGORY_RP_HANDOFF] intent category and a
 * [META_PAIR_SCHEME] `<meta-data>`; Cruciform's [RpPairLauncher] resolves those and
 * this object maps each resolved advert to a target. A button appears only for a
 * target that actually resolves on the phone — unknown or absent apps get the
 * Sharesheet fallback.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin (no android.* imports) so the URI/label/scheme logic is unit-tested on
 * the JVM; the Android `PackageManager` query that produces the [RpHandoffAdvert]s
 * lives in [RpPairLauncher].
