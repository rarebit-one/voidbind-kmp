package one.rarebit.cruciform.handoff

/**
 * The **same-phone one-tap** channel (ADR-0008): the relying-party app this phone just
 * handed an invite to reports, over a LOCAL intent the relay cannot touch, the two
 * values a human would otherwise have compared by eye —
 *
 *     cruciform://pair-joined?session=<relay session>&dev=<its ed25519:… device key>&sas=<its SAS>
 *
 * — so the SAS check is satisfied by the *apps*, not by the person holding the phone.
 * The intent is not a new authority: it is a SECOND channel. Cruciform still runs the
 * full commit-before-reveal handshake over the relay and still derives its own SAS and
 * learns the responder's device key from the relay reveal; this callback is only
 * compared against that. A relay man-in-the-middle would substitute its own key on the
 * relay channel and could not forge the app's local report, so the comparison fails and
 * nothing is signed — which is exactly what the human comparison bought us on two
 * devices. Cross-device pairing has no such channel and keeps the human SAS.
 *
 * Nothing here trusts the caller: the values are compared, never adopted. Pure Kotlin
 * (no `android.*`) so every decision below is unit-tested on the JVM.
