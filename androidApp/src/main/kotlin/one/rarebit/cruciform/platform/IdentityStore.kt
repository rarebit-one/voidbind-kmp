/**
 * On-device persistence for the provisioned identity. **Public** material (the
 * admitting op, the membership replica, the user + device public keys, the device
 * name, the trusted-site list) lives in plain SharedPreferences — none of it can
 * authenticate as the user. **Secret** material is sealed in hardware via
 * [SealedSecretStore]:
 *
 *  - `device-enc` — the X25519 device encryption private key (no secure element
 *    holds an agreement key; sealed at rest per ADR-0001).
 *  - `recovery` — the 32-byte recovery secret, optionally kept on an install that
 *    created or restored the identity, so the app can re-show it from Settings and
 *    act as GENESIS for recovery re-adds. Genesis bypasses the co-signed remove
 *    quorum, so this copy is sealed under a **strong-biometric-only** key
 *    ([SecretSealer.sealStrong]) — a screen-lock PIN cannot reach it — and the user
 *    can remove it. It is NOT needed to add a device (ADR-0005): any member admits
 *    the next with its device key.
 *
 * **Membership (ADR-0005).** `cert` holds this device's ADMITTING op — the
 * credential it presents — and `ops` the replica of the identity's membership ops
 * it knows (newline-joined tokens). An install from before 0.5.0 has a v2 cert and
 * no `ops`; a v2 cert IS a genesis add, so [knownOps] simply merges the cert in and
 * [load] writes the replica on first read — no re-enrolment, nothing lost.
 *
 * The library never persists anything — this is entirely the app's plumbing.
