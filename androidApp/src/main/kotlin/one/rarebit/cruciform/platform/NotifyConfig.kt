/**
 * The **push/wake plane** base URL: its default and its validation — the notify
 * half of what [RelayConfig] is for pairing. Pure Kotlin (no Android types) so the
 * rules are unit-tested on the JVM; [NotifySettings] is the persisted half.
 *
 * The library appends `/v1/subscriptions` to whatever base it is handed
 * ([one.rarebit.voidbind.net.NotifyClient]), so this is the plane's mount point.
 *
 * The plane is a **wake channel, not a crypto path**: this phone registers a public
 * ntfy topic URL with it and is later woken by an opaque login tuple. No key
 * material, no challenge and no match number ever crosses it — the login is still
 * pulled from the relying party over its own transport and signed hardware-gated.
