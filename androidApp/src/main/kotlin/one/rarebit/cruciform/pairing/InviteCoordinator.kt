/**
 * The lifecycle of ONE pairing invite this device mints as the initiator, owned by the
 * app (a ViewModel scope), not by a screen (ADR-0007).
 *
 * Why: the initiator's relay handshake used to run in a `LaunchedEffect` on the Connect
 * screen. The moment the user switched to the relying-party app on the same phone — to
 * create its key behind a fingerprint, tens of seconds — the effect was cancelled, the
 * initiator never posted its reveal, and on return the screen either timed out or minted
 * a fresh invite (the node relay saw 6 invites in 12 minutes for one enrolment). Here the
 * handshake is a [Job] in [scope] keyed by the invite; screens OBSERVE [state] and never
 * restart it on recomposition or return, [ensureInvite] never re-mints while an invite is
 * live, and a [ProcessKeepAlive] (a foreground service on Android) holds the process
 * while we wait — up to the relay's session TTL, with a visible countdown.
