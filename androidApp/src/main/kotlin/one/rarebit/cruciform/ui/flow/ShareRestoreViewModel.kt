 * at a time: each share is checked the moment it is added (a typo, a share of another
 * set, the same share twice), progress counts toward the threshold the first share
 * states, and once exactly enough are in, [restore] combines them and restores through
 * the engine's usual [VoidbindEngine.restoreIdentity] path, with the rebuilt secret in
 * its bech32m form.
 *
 * **Memory only.** The shares are secret material, so they live in this ViewModel and
 * nowhere else: no SavedStateHandle, no saved-instance Bundle. Process death forgets
 * them and the person types them again. [startOver] and [onCleared] drop them.
