/**
 * Creating an identity: provision it, then show the recovery secret to back up.
 * (Restoring passes the typed secret straight to the engine — it is never held here.)
 *
 * **Survives process death:** only a "creation started" flag. The recovery secret is
 * deliberately NOT persisted (memory only, never in the saved-state Bundle). What the
 * flag buys: [create] runs at most once per flow — a rotation keeps the secret on
 * screen instead of provisioning again (which the old composition-scoped state did),
 * and after process death the flow does not silently create a SECOND identity over the
 * first; it tells the user to back up the secret from Settings instead.
