/**
 * Per-RP **approval policy** — how much consent friction a known relying party gets
 * on the web-login approval sheet. This is policy/consent state that sits AROUND the
 * existing hardware-gated signature; it never changes the crypto path. Every login
 * still produces the same biometric-gated Ed25519 assertion (see
 * [one.rarebit.voidbind.flow.LoginApproval]) — the policy only decides whether the
 * app shows the full consent review or a streamlined confirmation for a site the
 * user already trusts.
 *
 * Two states:
 *  - [AlwaysAsk] — show the full consent sheet every time. This is the state of a
 *    brand-new RP, and the state a user can pin to force review forever.
 *  - [TrustedTofu] — **trust-on-first-use**: after one successful approval the RP is
 *    remembered as trusted and later logins may be streamlined.

 * identifier — its host). A brand-new RP has NO [SitePolicy] at all; the absence is
 * itself "always ask, never yet trusted". Persist this via a [SitePolicyStore].
 *
 * [pinnedAlwaysAsk] is the user override: when true, a successful login must NOT
 * silently upgrade the site to [ApprovalPolicy.TrustedTofu] — the user asked to be
 * prompted every time, and trust-on-first-use must respect that. [firstTrustedAt] is
 * the unix-seconds timestamp of the approval that first trusted the site (null while
 * it is still [ApprovalPolicy.AlwaysAsk]).
