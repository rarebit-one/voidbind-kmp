package one.rarebit.voidbind.policy

/**
 * The **app-facing coordinator** for per-RP approval policy + the approval audit log.
 * It binds the pure [ApprovalPolicyMachine] transitions to a persistent
 * [SitePolicyStore] and [ApprovalAuditLog], and is the single seam the platform
 * engines (Android `DeviceVoidbindEngine`, iOS `VoidbindEngine`) call.
 *
 * It holds NO crypto and touches NO network — it records consent decisions and
 * remembers trust. The hardware-gated signature is produced by
 * [one.rarebit.voidbind.flow.LoginApproval] exactly as before; the engine calls
 * [recordApproval] / [recordDenial] around that unchanged call.
 *
 * @param policies where per-RP [SitePolicy] is persisted.
 * @param audit where each decision is appended.
 * @param clock unix-seconds source (injected for testability).
