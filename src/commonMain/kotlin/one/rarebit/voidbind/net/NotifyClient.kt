/**
 * Client for Voidbind's **push/wake notify plane** (voidbind-go `notify`): the
 * device side that registers — and later drops — an ntfy / UnifiedPush wake
 * endpoint so a push login can reach this phone without a scanned QR.
 *
 * Wire (byte-identical to voidbind-go/notify/handler.go):
 * ```
 * POST   {base}/v1/subscriptions  {cert, channel, endpoint}
 *        -> 200 { user_id, device_key, channel, expires_at }
 * DELETE {base}/v1/subscriptions  {cert}                       -> 204
 * ```
 * Both are **cert-authenticated**: the request carries only the device's enrolment
 * cert token, and the plane binds the subscription to the authenticated
 * `(user, device)` the cert names — never to fields the client sent. A device can
 * therefore only register or unsubscribe ITSELF. An un-enrolled device is refused
 * (the plane's 401), surfaced here as a thrown [IllegalStateException].
 *
 * The plane is a **wake channel, not a crypto path**: registration hands over a
 * public ntfy topic URL and nothing else. This client never sees a private key, a
 * challenge, or a match number — those live in [WebLoginClient] / [WebLogin].
