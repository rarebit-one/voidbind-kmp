/**
 * The client-side policy for presenting a [DeviceCredential]: **re-mint and retry
 * once on `401`**, never fail hard on a stale proof.
 *
 * A relying party answers every `Device` refusal with the same undifferentiated
 * `401` — an expired proof, a not-yet-valid one (device clock behind), a revoked
 * cert, an unknown device. The first two are cured by a fresh proof; the rest are
 * not, and a second `401` is surfaced as-is. So one retry is the whole strategy.
 *
 * This is deliberately transport-agnostic — no OkHttp, no `HttpTransport`, no
 * coroutine runtime — so an OkHttp `Interceptor`, a Ktor plugin, a `URLSession`
 * wrapper and a plain blocking client all drive the SAME decision:
 *
 * - [next] is the pure state machine: given the attempt number and the status the
 *   server answered, either you are [Next.DONE] or you [Next.REFRESH_AND_RETRY].
 * - [execute] is the generic driver over any request/response type. It is `inline`,
 *   so [send] may be a blocking call or a `suspend` call — the caller's context decides.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // OkHttp interceptor, sketch:
 * override fun intercept(chain: Chain): Response = DeviceAuthPolicy.execute(
 *     credential,
 *     statusOf = { it.code },
 *     send = { header -> chain.proceed(chain.request().newBuilder().header("Authorization", header).build()) },
 * )
 * ```
