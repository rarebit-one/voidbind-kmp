 * (Adding a *second* device instead goes over the relay with the SAS handshake —
 * [net.PairflowInitiator]/[net.PairflowResponder]; this is only the bootstrap
 * case where one device holds both keys.)
 *
 * The cert is a v2 [Cert] (byte-identical to voidbind-go), signed by the user key,
 * that a voidbind-go relying party accepts unchanged.
