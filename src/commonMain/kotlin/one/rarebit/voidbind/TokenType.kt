/**
 * The token-type claim of voidbind-go ADR-0009: every signed token names its kind in
 * a `typ` member, placed **second** in the body, right after `v`. It is a byte-exact
 * port of voidbind-go `internal/sigtoken.Typ` / `CheckTyp`.
 *
 * Phase 1 ("accept", which this implements) verifies `typ` when a token carries it
 * and still accepts an untyped token under the legacy rules. Nothing emits `typ` by
 * default yet. Minting starts in phase 2, once every verifier accepts it, through
 * the internal typed mint paths ([MembershipOp.signTyped],
 * [one.rarebit.voidbind.auth.PossessionProof.mintTyped], and [Cert.typ]).
 *
 * Values are dotted, not slashed, so no JSON encoder ever escapes them, and they
 * are compared byte-for-byte.
