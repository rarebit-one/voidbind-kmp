/**
 * The device side of **web QR-login** as one app flow: the user scans a
 * `voidbind:login?rp=&id=` QR on a browser, the app shows WHAT they are signing
 * into, and — only after the human taps Approve — the device signs the RP's
 * challenge with its hardware key and submits the assertion. The RP then verifies
 * it offline against the pinned user key and mints a short-lived session token.
 *
 * Two steps so the biometric prompt lands at the human's decision, not at scan:
 *  1. [begin] decodes the QR and FETCHES the challenge from the RP (the RP is the
 *     source of truth for what is signed) → a [Request] the approval sheet shows.
 *  2. [approve] signs the exact fetched challenge and POSTs the assertion.
 *
 * Blocking (network); run it off the main thread. Wraps [WebLoginClient] +
 * [WebLogin.signAssertion] — every signed byte is byte-identical to voidbind-go.
