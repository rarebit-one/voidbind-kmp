/**
 * The **existing device authorising a new one**, as one app flow (the mirror of
 * [DevicePairing]). Under ADR-0005 / voidbind-go ADR-0007 this device is ANY
 * member of the identity — it signs the new device's add op with its own hardware
 * key, citing the heads of the membership ops it holds; no recovery secret is
 * involved. (The genesis form — the recovery key itself — survives for the first
 * device and for re-admitting a removed device, which only genesis can do.)
 *
 * It opens a relay session, shows the new device a `voidbind:pair?…` invite QR
 * (v3, carrying the identity), runs the commit-before-reveal handshake, displays
 * the 7-digit SAS, and — only after the human confirms both screens match — signs
 * the add op, seals it with the ops to the new device's X25519 key, and posts it.
 *
 * Three steps around the human gate:
 *  1. [invite] opens the session + returns the [Invitation.inviteQr] to render.
 *  2. [handshake] runs once the new device joins → the SAS to compare.
 *  3. [authorise] (only after the human matches the SAS) signs + seals + delivers,
 *     and returns the ops this device now holds (including the add it just signed)
 *     for the app to record in its replica.
 *
 * Blocking (the relay is polled); run it off the main thread. [clock] supplies
 * unix seconds (`commonMain` has no clock) for the op's issued-at.
